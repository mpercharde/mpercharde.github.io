Between 2013-2015, Bryony worked on zebrafish development in Julia Horsfield’s lab at Otago, first as an Honours student and subsequently an Assistant Research Fellow. In 2015, Bryony joined James Turner’s lab at the Francis Crick Institute for her PhD, working on DNA methylation in marsupial embryonic development. In 2021 Bryony joined the Percharde lab as a post-doc. Outside the lab, Bryony enjoys netball, sewing, and hiking/birdwatching (attempting to identify British birds she has never seen before).</p>

                    <p> Audrey completed her PhD in 2023 in the Eric Miska lab at the Gurdon Institute and the Department of Genetics at the University of Cambridge. In her PhD research, 
                      using East African cichlid fishes, known for their extraordinary rates of diversification, she employed multi-omic strategies to explore the role of the epigenome 
                      in mediating plasticity in novel environments. In 2024, she began her postdoc at the MRC LMS in the Percharde and Vaquerizas labs, identifying new roles for 
                      transposable elements in cancer and senescence. Outside of the lab, she enjoys boxing, cold-water scuba diving, and seeing new places. </p>

                  Kamila did her MPhil investigating structural methods to interrogate chromatin organisation in development, joint with the Hajkova lab and the RFI. She undertook a BSc in Genetics at Aberystwyth University and MSc Regenerative Medicine at the University of Edinburgh. Before her PhD, she worked in Duncan Sproul's lab at the University of Edinburgh as a research assistant, where she focused on DNA methylation in cancer development and progression. If she is not working, you will find her practicing yoga, training pole dance, or crocheting a new project while listening to podcasts.  </p>
